Transitions options
<----------------------------->
•Transition delay
•Transition timing function

<---------------------------->
01. transition-timing-function => how the change in the property will occur.

    ease :the change starts slow then go faster then finishes slow
    linear:the change occurs at the same rate
    ease-in:the change starts slow then go faster before the end
    ease-out :the change starts fast then slows down before the end
    ease-in-out:the change starts slow then go faster then finishes slow

02. transition-delay 
    
    •The time before the transition starts
    •Accepts values in seconds or milliseconds
<--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
The transform property has four functions that we can use to control how our elements will be displayed and
those functions are :
1. the scale function which allows us to resize the elements meaning to increase or decrease their height or width, 
2. the translate function which allows us to move the element and change its position to any spot on the browser horizontally or vertically, 
3. the rotate function which allows us to rotate the elements and into the environment by any degree or any number of turns we want and 
4. this skew function which allows us to skew the elements along theX-axis or the yaxis.
<-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
Transform scale x and the scale function accepts numbers that indicate how much the width
of the element will change relative to its original width.
for example:
if I added two here this will make the image with increased to twice the original size.
So if it was one pixels it will be 200 pixels.
And if I change the two to 1.5 it will be 150 pixels.
